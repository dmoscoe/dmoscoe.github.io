# Welcome!

This site showcases some of the major projects I've completed as a master's student at the [City University of New York](https://sps.cuny.edu/academics/graduate/master-science-data-science-ms).  

Click [here](about.md) to learn a bit more about me and my data science journey. You can also view my [resume](resume.pdf).  

Thanks for visiting!

* Built on previous research to compare various pushback rate control strategies under uncertainty;  
* Validated the model by comparing results with data from Boston Logan Airport.

* Used logistic regression and random forest models to predict whether customers will terminate their contracts;  
* Performed feature engineering to generate a measure of competition among cell phone carriers within each state;  
* Performed hypothesis tests to gain further insights.  
* Data/description at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/customer-churn-prediction-2020/overview).

* Worked with classmates to determine the most sought-after data science skills;  
* Conducted text mining on a corpus of job listings scraped from the web;  
* Produced visualizations to illustrate key findings.

## An Intro to Data Visualization for High School Students
[View the repo](https://github.com/dmoscoe/HCIS)  
* Students work in Python to construct histograms and analyze descriptive statistics.

## House Prices
