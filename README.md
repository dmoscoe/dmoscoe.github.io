# Welcome!

This site showcases some of the major projects I've completed as a [master's](http://catalog.sps.cuny.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=2&poid=607) student and beyond.  

Click [here](about.md) to learn a bit more about me and my data science journey. You can also view my [resume](resume.md).

## Predicting Academic Outcomes with DAACS
[Read the paper](/daacs/paper.pdf)  
[View the summary slides](/daacs/slides.pdf)  
[View the repo](https://github.com/dmoscoe/DAACS2)  
* Developed an early alert system for academic risk, directing support to students before they fail a course  
* Predictive models combine linear, tree, and non-parametric components  
* Implemented in R on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

## Electricity Explorer

* Designed interactive visualizations on the web showing electricity generation dynamics across the US  
* Implemented in Python with Pandas and Plotly

## Moneyball
[View the repo](https://github.com/dmoscoe/DATA621)  
* Led a team of classmates to predict the performance of baseball teams  
* Used R to perform feature engineering and construct linear regression models to minimize root mean square error
