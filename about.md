# About Me

I've always been passionate about helping people use reason and evidence to guide their thinking and decisions. From 2010-2020, I worked as a high school and middle school math teacher. During this time I developed innovative curricular materials that drove student engagement. My goal was to create opportunities for students to grow sophisticated understanding of core mathematical concepts, as well as for students to communicate their understanding in a variety of ways. This dual focus on conceptual sophistication and clear communication is also a guiding principle for my work as a data scientist.

Since 2016 I also served as chair of my school's math department, helping to lead a team of teachers working on courses from 6th grade to AP Calculus. In this capacity, I worked with my colleagues to develop evidence-based practices for delivering meaningful feedback to students. This meaningful feedback not only reported a grade, but led students to revise their work and ultimately improve their learning. I also worked with administrators to coordinate broad instructional themes across content areas in both middle school and high school.

For me, the transition into data science is an opportunity to expand my passion for reason and evidence by developing new technical skills and working with new stakeholders. The work in this portfolio shows how I use my primary tools of R, Python, and a deep understanding of statistics to build from raw data to a decision or insight. Communicating with precision and clarity is a guiding principle in all of my work.

When I'm away from my desk, you can find me hiking, at a book club, or exploring with my dog, Theo.
